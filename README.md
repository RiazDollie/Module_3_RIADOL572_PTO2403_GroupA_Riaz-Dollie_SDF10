## [SDF10] API Learning Reflection ðŸ§ 

Welcome to the [SDF10] API Learning Reflection! Through this exercise, you will reflect on key concepts, practical experiences, and the tools you've encountered or used in API interactions.

1. **Understanding and Application**: Reflecting on the key concepts, can you explain in your own words what an API is and its significance in software development? Provide an example of how you have used or encountered an API in a project or a practical scenario.

An API (Application Programming Interface) is an interface that allows software applications to communicate effectively with each other as well as allowing devices to communicate with web servers. It creates a set of rules that specifies what is allowed to be exchanged, promotes code reusability and overall is jujst a flexible approach to software development.

2. **Conceptual Distinctions**: How would you differentiate between an interface and an API? 

An interface specifies rules within a singular system and defines how different parts of the same application interacts with each other. While an API facilitates communication between different software applications.

3. **Components and Types of APIs**: Can you identify the main components of an API and describe their roles? Reflect on the different types of APIs mentioned (e.g., Web APIs, RESTful APIs) and discuss which type you find most intriguing or useful, and why.

Endpoints: This refers to the path as to where the api's functions can be accessed, for example a domain for a website.

Data Formats: When you exchange data between a client and servers through API's, it needs to be stored and structured in a specific way. And this can be done in the form of JSON or XML.

Methods: Also knowns as verbs or just HTTP methods refers to the actions and/or operations that can be excuted within the API's endpoints. Such as GET (retreiving data), POST (submitting data), PUT (insert or update existing data), DELETE (fairly obvious, but it erases data)

Web API's are fairly standard and in my opinon quite "boring", but only because we interact with them daily in a sense that we're always on the internet these days. To me the most intriguing are Hardware API's, because i'm quite interested in the building of computer components specifically and how they interact with the software systems that require them to be able to run effectively.



4. **Practical Application and Tools**: Reflect on your experience with API exploration and implementation. Have you used any specific tools (such as Curl or API exploration tools) or libraries to interact with APIs? 

I've always had a vague understanding of what an API is and what it does, but now that it's all been explained to me it's become even more intriguing. I haven't personally used specific tools as of just yet as I'm delving quite hard into the specifics of hardware API's but it will come eventually.

5. **Learning and Improvement**: Considering the key concepts and your practical experiences, identify one area related to APIs where you feel confident and one area where you see a need for improvement. What steps will you take to enhance your understanding and skills in the area you wish to improve?

I feel quite confident overall, however I feel that my interest in one part of API's (Hardware), if im not careful I'll end up focusing soley on it and neglect my research and understanding of the other parts and concepts relating to API's. So far the only thing I think i can improve on is time management.
